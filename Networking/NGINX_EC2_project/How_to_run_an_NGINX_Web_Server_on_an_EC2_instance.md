In this README I will walk you through how to run an NGINX server on an AWS EC2 instance, and map it to a Cloudflare domain.


 # 1. Buy a domain on Cloudflare
You start by choosing a domain registrar to search for the site you want. I recommend picking a cheap domain, even if it has an unusual extension. For my project, I chose mahamedismail.uk.
